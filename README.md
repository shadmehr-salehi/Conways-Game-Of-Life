# Conways Game Of Life
### Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that is played on a 2D square grid.  <br>
Each square (or "cell") on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they evolve according to the following rules: <br>
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (referred to as
underpopulation)
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (referred to as
overpopulation)
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives unchanged to the next
generation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.

Cellular automata are a class of mathematical models that describe the behavior of
systems composed of discrete, locally interacting elements. <br> 
The elements are often represented as cells on a regular lattice, such as a two-dimensional grid, and the state of
each cell is updated according to a set of rules that depend on the state of its neighbors. <br>
Cellular automata have been used to model a wide variety of phenomena, including
physical systems, biological systems, and social systems.
